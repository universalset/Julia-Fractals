    "We can change the color scheme by specifying a vector of color specifications, each of which is a triple of RGB values between 0.0 (no saturation) and 1.0 (full saturation).  The fractal generator chooses a color for each pixel by checking how many iterations the function takes to escape (exceed an absolute value threshhold) when iteration is started on a complex number corresponding to that pixel.  It then interpolates between the colors in the list based on the number of iterations taken as a fraction of the `maxiters` parameter.\n",

If you don't like the image colors after changing `maxiters` (especially if it seems faint or lacking in contrast) consider changing the `colors` as well.\n",
